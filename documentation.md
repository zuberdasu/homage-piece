#Homage Piece

The aim of the homage piece was to look at the home page of an existing website and create a similar looking website using only HTML and CSS. The project was created before JavaScript had been taught on the coding bootcamp.

I aimed to replicate the homepage of [BMW](https://www.bmw.co.uk/en/index.html).

There are still some aspects of the page that need to be worked on such as:

- hover effects for hyperlinks
- sizing, spacing and positioning
- the suggested models section going over the screen width
- tidying of the code, reducing repetion and use of SASS
